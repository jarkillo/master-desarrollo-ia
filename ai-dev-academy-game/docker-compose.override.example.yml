# Docker Compose Override for Easypanel Deployment
#
# USAGE:
#   On your VPS, copy this file to docker-compose.override.yml:
#   cp docker-compose.override.example.yml docker-compose.override.yml
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Easypanel handles port mapping through its own proxy (Traefik/Nginx).
#   This override file removes direct port mappings and lets Easypanel's
#   proxy handle routing via the Domains UI.
#
# DO NOT:
#   - Commit docker-compose.override.yml to git (it's in .gitignore)
#   - Expose ports directly when using Easypanel
#   - Use this file for local development (it will break port access)
